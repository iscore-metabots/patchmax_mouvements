Movement library for Metabots and movement interpolation
========================================================

#This project is divided into two parts:
* __Creation of a movement library__: Max/MSP interface and Python functions to send these movements to a Metabot.
* __Interpolation__: Computation of a curve close to the movement points in order to be able to make an initial movement vary.  

#Development:
* The API for interpolation is developped in Python and constituted of 7 main functions.
* A movement can be sent through the MAX/MSP interface or by using Python functions (read __MOUVEMENT.md__ for more informations).

#Documentation:
* The operating of the MAX/MSP interface is explained in __MOUVEMENT.md__.
* The operating of the interpolation part in explained in __API.md__. A documentation of each function is available by typing help(name_of_function) in shell.
