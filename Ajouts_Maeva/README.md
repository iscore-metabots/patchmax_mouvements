Movement library for Metabots and movement interpolation
========================================================

### Aims of this project:
* __Creation of a movement library__: Max/MSP interface and Python functions to send these movements to a Metabot.
* __Interpolation__: Computation of a curve close to the values of each motor in order to be able to make the initial movement vary.  

### Development:
* The API for interpolation is developped in Python and constituted of 7 main functions (see repertory "interpolation")
* A movement can be sent through the MAX/MSP interface or by using Python functions (read __MOUVEMENT.md__ for more informations, then see repertory "Max_IHM")

### Documentation:
* The operating of the MAX/MSP interface and the generation of movements are explained in __MOUVEMENT.md__.
* The operating of the interpolation part is explained in __interpolation/README.md__.

### State of the project and problems still not resolved: 

See file __TODO.md__.
